## To-Do List

- [X] Add more games (frecell, spider and yukon)
- [X] Improve the settings to use fragments
- [ ] Add more card drawables. Like the cards from KPatience, especially the Tux cards. But i don't find them anywhere...
- [ ] Add a color chooser for background color
- [X] Add even more games (Simple Simon, Golf, etc)

####Now contains 6 different Solitaire games!
Klondike, Freecell, Yukon, Spider, Simple Simon and Golf!
I test my changes and improve the UI before making a new release!


#Simple Solitaire
You can find screenshots for phones and tablets [here](./Pictures/screenshots)

I learned Android and Java by myself using e-books and browsing Stack Overflow for solutions, so please don't expect too much from my source code :D

It is a very simple game, but customizable and with some neat functions like hints. Here is my Google Play description:

Highly customizable:
There are 5 different looking card sets in this game, 12 different card backgrounds and 6 different background colours. So you have a large choice to customize your experience!

Automatic saving:
The current game will be saved every time you pause or close the app. So you can continue your game where you left it!

High Score list:
When winning a game, your score will be saved in a list of up to 10 high scores.

Game features:
This game has a undo function to take back up to 20 card movements. A hint function shows you up to 3 possible card movements at once.

Left handed mode:
There is a option for left handed people to mirror the card positions to the left side of the screen.

No ads:
This game is completely free without ads, tracking or something else. Just have fun :)

Landscape and tablet support: 
You can switch to landscape mode, this is better for larger screens.
